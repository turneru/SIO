Society for Interventional Oncology

A completely redesigned website for the Society for Interventional Oncology, built on DotNetNuke (DNN). As the front-end web developer on this project I collaborated with graphic designers on the creative team, project managers, and the marketing team to implement high-fidelity designs from Adobe XD into a responsive and interactive website. The design features tailored elements like a news ticker, large circular video, carousel for upcoming events, and animations using the Animate On Scroll plugin. The site is optimized for scalability, and is built using SCSS for clean and intuitive code.
